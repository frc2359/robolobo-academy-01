# Autograding Example: Java
This example project is written in Java, and tested with Gradle/JUnit.

### The assignment
The tests are currently failing because of an output mismatch. Fixing the `System.out.println` in the main method will make the tests green.

### Setup command
N/A

### Run command
`gradle test`

### Notes
- The JDK is installed on GitHub Actions machines, so you're also able to directly invoke `javac`, `java`, or any other CLI command included in the JDK.

## Lesson One

### Objective: Print "Hello World"
Just as simple as it seems! Watch [the tuorial video from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PfRJ2l8MPSQqmQIUL13inbGjOkGEBcRY/view?usp=sharing), and create a simple `Tester.java` (CASE SENSITIVE - FORMAT FILENAME CORRECTLY OR IT WON'T WORK) with a main method that prints `hello world`.
